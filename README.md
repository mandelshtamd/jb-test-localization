# Localization task

This is an implementation of a payment email localized ro several languages


## Description

* In my solution, I used the division of the original letter into lexemes, which, depending on the required language, 
  are loaded from the xml file. XML file is parsed using the XmlLexemeParser class inherited from the SAX parser.
  

* Solution supports 3 languages: english, russian and german
